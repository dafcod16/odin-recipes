    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>Fried rice is a quick and easy meal that allows you to improvise and substitute many ingredients depending on what you have at home. <br>
    My favorite thing about this dish is that is incredibly cheap to make and you probably have most of these ingredients lying around your pantry already.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Scramble your eggs: </strong>Using a small pat of butter, scramble some eggs in a large <br>
            sauté pan, breaking them into small pieces as you go. Then transfer the eggs to a <br>
            separate plate, and set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Saute your veggies and garlic:</strong> Return your sauté pan to the heat, and sauté the <br>
            onions, carrots, peas and garlic until soft and cooked through.</li>
        <li><strong>Stir fry the rice: </strong>Then turn the burner to high heat. Scooch the veggies over to one <br>
            side of the pan, melt the remaining butter in the other half, and add the chilled <br>
            rice, soy sauce, and oyster sauce (if using). Then stir to combine with the veggies <br>
            and continue sautéing the rice, stirring every 15-20 seconds or so for 3 minutes, <br>
            or until you notice the rice and veggies starting to brown slightly.</li>
        <li><strong>Temove pan from heat: </strong>And stir in your green onions, sesame oil, and scrambled <br>
            eggs.</li>
        <li><strong>Taste and season. </strong>Give the rice a taste, and season with salt and pepper, plus any <br>
            extra soy sauce or sesame oil if needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve! </strong>Then dish it up and serve nice and warm!</li>
    </ol>
