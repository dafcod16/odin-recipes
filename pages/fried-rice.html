    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>Fried rice is a quick and easy meal that allows you to improvise and substitute many ingredients depending on what you have at home. <br>
    My favorite thing about this dish is that is incredibly cheap to make and you probably have most of these ingredients lying around your pantry already.</p>
